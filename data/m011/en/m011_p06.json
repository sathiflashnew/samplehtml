The rate at which the dough rises is controlled by controlling the temperature, because dough proofs faster in warmer conditions and slower in cooler conditions.</p><p>Dough management is a continuous process that begins with the QCC, continues during storage, and ends when it is actually baked into pizzas, breadsticks, or cheesesticks.</p><p>The main principle of dough management is that the lesser the time the dough remains at 40 degrees Fahrenheit or above, the slower the proofing process will be.</p>"],
