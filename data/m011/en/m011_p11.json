Reports are used to project food preparation levels.</p><p>Reports are generated by using sales projections and food yield information for your restaurant to project how much dough will be needed each business day and each hour of the current day. For example, you and your manager will use the reports to project your hourly dough needs for the current day and the dough supply needs for the next two days.</p>"],
